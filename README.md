- #### Founder of [Subter](https://www.subter.io)
- #### Seasoned technologist and Crowd Sourcer

While I still sling a fair amount of code for fun and profit my focus these days is on Innovation, Crowd Sourcing, and the Future of Work. 

I believe decentralized systems are the future and that cryptography is the key to privacy, innovation, and a free society.
